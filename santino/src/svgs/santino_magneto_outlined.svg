It seems like you're trying to save a project to a specific directory on your computer. However, as an AI text-based model, I don't have the capability to interact with your file system or perform file operations directly.

To save your project to the specified directory, you can follow these general steps depending on the software you are using:

1. **In a Code Editor or IDE (like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.):**
   - Go to the "File" menu.
   - Select "Save As" or "Save".
   - Navigate to `G:\My Drive\dev\santino`.
   - Enter a name for your project file and click "Save".

2. **In a Document Editor (like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.):**
   - Click on "File".
   - Choose "Save As" or "Download".
   - Select the location `G:\My Drive\dev\santino`.
   - Name your document and save it.

3. **Using Command Line (if applicable):**
   - Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
   - Use a command like `cp` (for copy) or `mv` (for move) to save your project files to the desired directory.

If you need more specific instructions based on the software you are using, please let me know!
