It seems like you're trying to save a project to a specific directory on your computer. However, as an AI text-based model, I don't have the capability to interact with your file system or perform actions like saving files directly.

To save your project to the specified directory, you can follow these general steps depending on the software you are using:

1. **In most applications (like text editors, IDEs, etc.):**
   - Click on `File` in the menu.
   - Select `Save As...`.
   - Navigate to `G:\My Drive\dev\santino`.
   - Enter a name for your project file.
   - Click `Save`.

2. **If you're using a command line:**
   - You can use a command like `cp` (on Unix-like systems) or `copy` (on Windows) to move or save files to that directory.

3. **In programming environments:**
   - You might need to specify the path in your code to save files to that directory.

If you provide more context about the software or programming language you're using, I can give more specific instructions!
