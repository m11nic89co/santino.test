It seems like you're trying to save a project to a specific directory on your computer. However, as a text-based AI, I don't have the capability to interact with your file system or save files directly. 

To save your project to the specified directory, you can follow these general steps depending on the software you are using:

1. **In most applications (like text editors, IDEs, etc.):**
   - Click on `File` in the menu.
   - Select `Save As...`.
   - Navigate to `G:\My Drive\dev\santino`.
   - Enter a name for your project file.
   - Click `Save`.

2. **If you're using a command line:**
   - You can use a command like `cp` (for copying files) or `mv` (for moving files) to transfer your project files to the desired directory.

If you need more specific instructions, please let me know what software or programming environment you are using!
