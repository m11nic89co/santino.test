# Santino Project Audit (August 2025)

## 1. Overview
- **Type:** Static website (HTML/CSS/JS, no backend)
- **Main file:** `index.html` (well-structured, modern, single-page)
- **Assets:** SVG/PNG icons, webmanifest, custom font, brand logos
- **No build system or external JS/CSS files detected**

## 2. Structure & Assets
- **index.html:** Large, contains all CSS/JS inline. Modern, responsive, and visually rich.
- **assets/logos:** 13 SVG brand logos, all referenced in the ticker.
- **Favicons & Touch Icons:** All standard sizes present and referenced in `<head>`.
- **Webmanifest:** Present, valid, with icons and theme color.
- **robots.txt:** Disallows all crawling (site is not indexed).
- **Custom font:** `magneto_bold.ttf` present, but not referenced in CSS (Google Fonts used as fallback).
- **No README found.**
- **No external JS or CSS files.**

## 3. HTML/CSS/JS Quality
- **SEO:** Meta tags present, but robots set to noindex/nofollow (site is hidden from search engines).
- **Accessibility:** Good use of `alt` attributes, semantic tags, and ARIA labels.
- **Performance:**
  - All CSS/JS is inline (fast for small sites, but hard to maintain for large ones).
  - Uses modern CSS (variables, media queries, transitions).
  - No unused assets detected.
- **Responsiveness:** Extensive media queries for mobile/desktop.
- **Branding:** All logos referenced and present.

## 4. Recommendations
- **Add a README.md** with project purpose, deployment, and editing instructions.
- **Consider splitting CSS/JS** into separate files for maintainability if the project grows.
- **Remove unused font file** (`magneto_bold.ttf`) if not needed.
- **If public, update robots.txt and meta robots** to allow indexing.
- **Add LICENSE file** if open source or for clarity.
- **Add versioning or changelog** if the project is updated regularly.

## 5. Security & Best Practices
- No user data or backend, so minimal security risk.
- All external resources are from trusted sources (Google Fonts).
- No third-party analytics or trackers detected.

---

**Overall:**
- The project is clean, modern, and well-structured for a static site.
- Only minor improvements are suggested for documentation and maintainability.
